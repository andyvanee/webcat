# exec | webcat

Reading a lot of text in the terminal sucks. Why not read it in your
web browser? Try this:

    info bison | webcat

Perhaps you want to preview something that is in markdown format?

    cat README.md | webcatmd

*Markdown.pl is included in this repo. Please see original and liscence here:*

## Install

Just put these scripts on your path or add this folder to your path:

    export PATH=/wherever/webcat:$PATH
